             <p>Now that the school year is almost complete, and the yearbook is coming to an end, we as students can reflect on our journey. This school year was by far my favorite in terms of learning ICT.
                    The teachings of our ICT teacher,w, I can do things that I would have never thought of doing before. Let us now reflect on our Grade 9 Journey.
                Please make sure your website zoom is 100% for best quality, thank you! </p>

                    <p> I truly believe that high school is one of the most important stages of our lives, it molds us to what we want to become in the future. It also teaches you about good habits, hardwork. It also teaches you how to choose your friends
                        that you would want to be accompanied with for the rest of your lives; and I see these scenarios happening in front of my own eyes during the first two years of being in LPSCI. Now that I am turning Grade 10, I think it is important to look back 
                        on my journey.

                    <p> This year, I met students that thrive in  school competitions, even reaching to nationals. These people inspire me to become better of what I want to do, which is web development.
                        I wish us both good luck in our careers. </p>

                       "High school teaches us about cooperation, uniting for a single goal, and working with each other despire cultural or mental differences. Not only does it prepare us for our adulthood, but it also 
                        boosts our morals as a person. High school is like a big family, we cannot just live on our own; we have to rely on others for our shortcomings, likewise, others have to rely on us.

<div class="sidebar">In my time as a Grade 9 student in Fairness, I have met so many different smart people who like to have fun. They balance academics with social life. I am happy to be a part of Fairness 2023-2024,
without these people, I would have never been motivated to do stuff i have never done before. </div><hr><br><br><br>

<div class="sidebar">Let us talk about the real heroes of our high school lives. Our teachers. For me, Grade 9 teachers are one of if not the best teachers that I have encountered yet. Sir Calimbas' passion in teaching AP made me admire him.
He is also concerned for our education. Even though he understandably gets upset sometimes, he is still one of the best Grade 9 teachers. Ms. Uminga's teachings about HTML introduced me to the world of software, which now I really find interesting.</div>

Two of my siblings are Lapiscian alumnis, they were able to have the full experience of monthly competitions and celebrations conducted in LPSCI grounds. Now, for the first time in two years, I can now get a taste of 
old LPSCI and I am sure there are more to come in the future, especially in Grade 10. This is one of the music we used for our ESP Variety Show.

In conclusion, this academic year molded me into a better person that is craving for knowledge. I know that there are more obstacles to come in Grade 10 and Senior High, but as students, we should enjoy
this time of pre-adulthood. Learning is a compassionate method only if the learner is also compassionate. For the next few years, I wanna learn more about coding languages and deepen my skills and understandings
about them. Thank you Ms. Uminga for laying a foundation to this. </section>
